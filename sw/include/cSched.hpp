/**
 * @brief Coyote run-time scheduler
 *
 * The scheduler is responsible for managing tasks and functions in the Coyote
 * Users can submit aritrary functions, defined through the cFunc class, to the scheduler.
 * Each function contains a path to its app bistream and the corresponding software-side code.
 * Then, the tasks can be submitted to the scheduler (most commonly done from the cService, though
 * it is possible to write code that interacts directly with the scheduler), which dispatches the tasks 
 * based on a scheduling policy. Where needed, the scheduler will also reconfigure the vFPGA bitstream
 * with the one correct for the function. Currently, there are two scheduling policieies implemented:
 * (1) first-come, first-served (FCFS) and (2) minimize reconfigurations. The second one will always
 * execute all the tasks with the same bitstream, avoiding the latency inccured by partial reconfiguration,
 * before proceeding to the next task with a different bitstream.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - Implement more scheduling policies, such as priority-based scheduling
