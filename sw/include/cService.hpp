/** 
 * @brief Coyote background service
 * 
 * This class implements the Coyote background service which 
 * runs on server node and can execute pre-defined Coyote functions.
 * On the client side, the users can connect to this service
 * through the helper class cConn and submit requests to the loaded 
 * functions. The service will automatically reconfigure the vFPGA
 * with the correct bistream. The requests can be local or remote.
 * 
 * @note There is currently a bug in terminating the signals. Since the signal handler
 * is static and limited in parameters, is it not aware of what instance should be terminated.
 * Therefore, for now, the signal handler terminates all instances of the service. Users should
 * only terminate the service once all vFPGAs have finished processing requests.
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - Remote connections
