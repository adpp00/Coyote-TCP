/**
 * @brief Base user function
 *
 * This class should not be used directly; instead it is be inherited in the cFunc class,
 * which defines the arbitrary user functions and the corresponding bitstreams.
 * Therefore this class is fully abstract and all the functions are pure virtual.
 * Additionally, since it is a fully abstract class, there is no corresponding .cpp file.
 *
 * The only reason this class exists is because the cFunc class has a variadic
 * template, making it difficult to include in other classes. For example,
 * the cService class keeps a map of functions added to the Coyote background service, and,
 * since each function is user-defined, it can have different templates and arguments.
