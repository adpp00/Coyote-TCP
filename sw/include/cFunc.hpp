 * @brief User-defined functions
 *
 * This class is a template for user-defined functions.
 * Each function is associated with a specific application bitstream
 * and the corresponding software-side function to be executed.
 * The functions are implemented using variadic templates to allow for
 * a variable number of parameters to be passed. This class is expected
 * to be used in conjuction with Coyote services (cService) and requests (cReq).
 * For an example, refer to Example 9 in examples/.
 *
 * @note Since this class is a template, it must be implemented in the header file
 * Otherwise, it leads to compilatiation errors. An alternative is to use
 * template specialization, but it is not applicable in this case, since the
 * function arguments are arbitrary and not known ahead of time.

     * simplest solutions, with no reliance on complex data types. Additionally, when the function
     * arguments are received in the server (processRequests() function), they are naurally written to a 
     * char buffer, since they are contigious, byte-addressable and easily cast to other data types.
