 * @brief Coyote reconfiguration class
 * Used for loading partial bitstreams to FPGA memory and triggering reconfiguration
 * Used for both shell reconfiguration (dynamic + user layer) and app reconfiguration (2nd-level PR)
 *
 * The most important function for users here is ```reconfigureShell(std::string bistream_path)````
 * Which is used to reconfigure the entire shell (dynamic + user layer); for more details see comments below
 * 
 * In general, the flow of reconfiguration is (all of which is abstracted by ```reconfigureShell```):
 *	- Allocate host-side, kernel memory to hold the partial bitsream (void* getMem, internally calling the Coyote driver)
 *  - Map the allocated memory to the user-space (using reconfig_mmap from the Coyote driver)
 *	- Load the bitsream from disk and store it to the allocated memory
 * 	- Trigger reconfiguration by writing the memory to FPGA memory and asserting the correct registers
 *  - Once complete, release the allocated memory (void freeMem, internally calling the Coyote driver)
