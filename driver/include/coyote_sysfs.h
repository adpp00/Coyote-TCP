/**
 * @file coyote_sysfs.h
 * @brief Coyote sysfs module
 *
 * sysfs is a virtual filesystem in Linux that exposes kernel objects and their attributes to the user-space
 * It can be used for reading and writing various attributes of devices in the kernel-space
 * The following methods retrieve or set attributes from memory-mapped FPGA registers
 * The attributes can also be read and set from a standard Linux terminal, e.g., cat /sys/kernel/coyote_sysfs_0/<attribute>
 *
 * In general, the methods in this file follow similar steps:
 *  1. Parse a generic kernel object (kobj) into a Coyote-specific variable of type bus_driver_data
 *  2. Ensure the parsed object is non-null, using BUG_ON(...)
 *  3. Retrieve or set the target attribute
