 * Functions in this file are primarily used for low-level hardware operations in the vFPGA
 * Typically, this includes writing to or reading from hardware registers, which are memory-mapped during driver loading
 * The registers typically start an operation in hardware or contain some control flow data (virtual address, length etc.)
