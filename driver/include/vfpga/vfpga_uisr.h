/**
 * @file vfpga_uisr.h
 * @brief vFPGA user interrupts (notifications)
 *
 * Methods to register user interrupt (notification) callbacks, as requested by the user
 * In Coyote, user interrupts (notifications) are linked to a Coyote thread, through its ID (ctid)
 * Therefore, there can be multiple interrupt callbacks for one vFPGA, since it's possible to have more than one Coyote thread per vFPGA
 * For more details, see Example 3: Multi-threading and Example 4: User interrupts 
 *
 * To handle interrupts, Coyote uses eventfd, a Linux kernel mechanism for event signalling
 * eventfd can be used to communicate events between the kernel- and the user-space, or between processes
 * In Coyote, an eventfd is created from the user-space and registered by the driver using the method vfpga_register_eventfd
 * Then, when an interrupt from the FPGA is picked up by the driver (see vfpga_isr.c), the driver writes to the appropariate eventfd
 * The user-space software polls on the same eventfd, and, when a change is detected, executes the appropriate callback (see sw/bThread.cpp)
