/**
 * @brief Allocates host-side, kernel-space reconfiguration buffers
 *
 * In order for partial bitstreams to be loaded onto the FPGA,
 * they need to be written to the ICAP from the driver via PCIe and the XDMA core
 * This function allocates a buffer of sufficient size to hold a partial bitstream for reconfiguration
 * Following this function, the buffer is mapped to the user-space using an mmap call (reconfig_ops.h)
 * Finally, the partial bitstream can then be loaded into this buffer and used to trigger reconfiguration
 *
 * @param device reconfig_device for which the bitstream buffer should be allocated
 * @param n_pages number of hugepages required to hold the bitsream; calculated in user-space
 * @param pid host process ID
 * @param crid configuration ID (uniquely identifies the shell bitstream to be loaded)
 * @return whether target memory allocation completed successfully
